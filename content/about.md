I am a customer-obsessed force multiplier who is passionate about productivity, effective communication, and great design. I gain deep satisfaction from helping clients achieve their goals and excel at being a seamless interface between our technical and non-technical teams.

I write about continuous self-improvement, tech, and governance at https://medium.com/@kahdojay

I love meeting and learning from new people - [say hello](#contact)!
