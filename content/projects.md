[Habit List Parser](https://github.com/kahdojay/habit-list-data-parser) is a basic CLI utility that takes your Habit List (an iOS app used to collect your daily habit/goal performance) JSON exports and gives you a quick overview of your performance during a given time period. [I use it to populate historical data and create a habit dashboard](https://medium.com/@kahdojay/collect-measure-and-analyze-your-habit-data-aea81c69630c).
